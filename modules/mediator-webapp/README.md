Executing MEDIator Web Application
---------
Instead of running MEDIator as a stand-alone application with RESTful interfaces, you may run the MEDIator web 
application, which is based on MEDIator and Embedded Tomcat.   
   

     sh modules/mediator-core/target/bin/webapp

   
   

Go to http://localhost:<EMBEDDED_TOMCAT_PORT>/mediator/ using your browser to access the Web Application.

By default, http://localhost/mediator/
