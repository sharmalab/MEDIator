# MEDIator

Skip to Running MEDIator Container section if you just want to use MEDIator in a container.

## Building MEDIator Using Apache Maven 3.x.x

MEDIator is built with JDK 1.8 and Apache Maven 3.

```
mvn package
```

## Building MEDIator Container

After building MEDIator locally, follow the below steps to build and push the MEDIator container.

```
$ sudo docker build -t mediator:1.0.0 .

$ sudo docker image ls

$ docker tag mediator:1.0.0 pradeeban/mediator:1.0.0

$ docker login

$ docker push pradeeban/mediator:1.0.0

```

## Configuring Access and Authentication for TCIA-SDK

Create config.yaml in your execution directory with the correct access information and credentials 
(TCIA user name and password) to access the TCIA REST API with authentication. 

Sample configuration files can be found at the conf folder (config.test.yaml and config.simple.test.yaml).


## Running MEDIator Locally on the host

Execute the MEDIatorEngine class to start MEDIator.

     java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -classpath lib/mediator-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:lib/*:conf/ edu.emory.bmi.mediator.core.MEDIatorEngine

You may extend or leverage the exposed APIs. To begin with, you may consume the MEDIator RESTful APIs through a REST
client such as the Postman plugin of the Chrome browser or test with the Python client included in the mediator-client package.

MEDIator, by default, runs on port 8040, that can be changed by changing the REST_PORT constant in the CommonConstants class.

The implementation of the RESTful invocations can be found at TciaReplicaSetManager.



Configuring MEDIator to run in a cluster
---------
First, configure jgroups correctly via jgroups.xml. We are using the TCP configurations here. Jgroups also can be 
configured with UDP.

Edit the below line with correct IP addresses. Please note that "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" does not work as an IP address here.

	initial_hosts="${jgroups.tcpping.initial_hosts:10.40.50.63[7800],10.40.50.63[7801],10.40.50.63[7802],10.40.50.63[7803]}"


To add more instances to the cluster, start the instances of Initiator class.

     java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -classpath lib/mediator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:lib/*:conf/ edu.emory.bmi.mediator.core.Initiator 

You will see logs similar to the below, as more Initiator instances join the MEDIator cluster:

	GMS: address=pradeeban-25946, cluster=ISPN, physical address=10.40.50.63:7802
    14:00:30.367 [main] INFO  org.infinispan.CLUSTER - ISPN000094: Received new cluster view for channel ISPN: [pradeeban-17789|2] (3) [pradeeban-17789, pradeeban-4769, pradeeban-25946]


## Running MEDIator Container

Alternatively, you may run MEDIator as a container.

```
$ docker run --name mediator -p 8040:8040 pradeeban/mediator:1.0.0
```

## Using MEDIator with TCIA

To create, update, replace, duplicate, and delete replicasets from the TCIA data, follow the REST client provided in modules/mediator-client/.
