## Building MEDIator Using Apache Maven 3.x.x

     mvn package


## Configuring Access and Authentication for TCIA-SDK

Create config.yaml in your execution directory with the correct access information and credentials 
(TCIA user name and password) to access the TCIA REST API with authentication. 

Sample configuration files can be found at the conf folder (config.test.yaml and config.simple.test.yaml).


Executing MEDIator
---------
Execute the MEDIatorEngine class to start MEDIator.

     java -classpath lib/mediator-core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:lib/*:conf/ edu.emory.bmi.mediator.core.MEDIatorEngine

You may extend or leverage the exposed APIs. To begin with, you may consume the MEDIator RESTful APIs through a REST
client such as the Postman plugin of the Chrome browser.


The implementation of the RESTful invocations can be found at TciaReplicaSetManager.
